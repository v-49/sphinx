## About RNAFusion

RNAFusion provides a unified platform for exploring and analyzing RNA velocity tools. These tools help predict cellular dynamics and understand gene expression regulation. Our project includes an interactive Sphinx-generated website that allows users to browse through various methods, view key innovations, and access the respective research papers and repositories.

## 15 RNA Velocity Tools

This project incorporates the following RNA velocity tools:

1. **velocyto** - A tool for RNA velocity analysis based on steady-state splicing kinetics.
2. **scVelo** - A dynamic modeling framework with EM and latent time for RNA velocity.
3. **VeloAE** - An autoencoder-based method incorporating GCN and attention mechanisms.
4. **VeloVAE** - Variational autoencoder for latent state RNA velocity estimation.
5. **UniTVelo** - Temporally unified, top-down method using radial basis functions.
6. **DeepVelo (2022)** - A neural differential equation model for RNA velocity.
7. **cellDancer** - Single-cell resolution inference for velocity kinetics using DNN.
8. **veloVI** - Variational inference with uncertainty modeling for RNA velocity.
9. **LatentVelo** - Neural ODE and variational autoencoder for RNA velocity in latent space.
10. **DeepVelo (2024)** - GCN-based method for multi-lineage RNA velocity estimation.
11. **STT** - Multiscale dynamical modeling for spatial transcriptomics and RNA velocity.
12. **dynamo** - GMM-based transcriptomic vector field model for RNA velocity.
13. **MultiVelo** - Multi-omic integration of RNA velocity and chromatin accessibility.
14. **PhyloVelo** - Phylogenetic analysis with RNA velocity incorporating gene expression.
15. **TFvelo** - Focuses on transcription factors and regulatory gene expression for RNA velocity.

Each tool is documented with:

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of the repository, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/RNAFusion.git
cd RNAFusion
```

2. Install Dependencies

This project uses Sphinx to generate documentation. Install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Build the Documentation Locally

You can build the documentation locally using the following command:

```bash
make html
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- Sphinx: Documentation generator.
- sphinx_rtd_theme: Read the Docs theme for Sphinx.
- Other tools: See `requirements.txt`.

## Running Locally

Ensure you have Python and pip installed.

Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run Sphinx to generate the documentation:

```bash
make html
```

Open `_build/html/index.html` to view the documentation locally.
